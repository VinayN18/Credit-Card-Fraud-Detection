# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Minor Project using Machine Learning


### Problem Statement
Credit risk is associated with the possibility of a client failing to meet contractual obligations,
such as mortgages, credit card debts, and other types of loans. The dataset contains transactions
made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents
transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.
The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all
transactions. These datasets are hard to handle. You have to predict whether, given the details
about the credit card, it is real or fake.
